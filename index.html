        <h3>I am a Computer and Communications Engineering student at the <a href = "https://www.aub.edu.lb/" style="color: #0645AD" target='_blank'><u>American University of Beirut</u></a></h3>
        <p align="justify">I am a technology enthusiast that is always curious to see and learn what has been invented and what challenges are being tackled. I always try to learn techniques and mechanisms to solve problems with the intent of creating my own way of solving. I always like learning how to use new software.

			My interest grew as the video game industry grew and was the main reason I am pursuing a career in software development although there is a growing interest in machine learning and data science, both of which are constantly growing fields which have a passionate community that doesnâ€™t say no to a challenge.

			I like working in groups although I am more of a support person since I personally see this role to be more important than most, where I would be given a task to finish, keep track with the entire project and give feedback to what is better and what could be improved. </p>

			<h3>Research Assistant for an NLP project</h3>
			<img  src="./assets/images/nlpres.png" style = "width:200px;">
			<p>I Worked for almost a year on a research with Professor <a href = "https://www.aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberId=fz11" style="color: #0645AD" target='_blank'><u>Fadi Zaraket</u></a> where I was responsible for Parsing Tweet data and formatting them in order to pass them to a machine learning model which would be trained to classify tweets under different categories.
			My job consisted of identifying stop words and "garbage" in tweets then remove them in 2 different languages, then find their lemmas. Furthermore I had to create several different models for word vectors of our data (one of the models being created using google's word2vec) then finally create a machine learning model that uses these as input and outputs to which category the tweet belongs to.
